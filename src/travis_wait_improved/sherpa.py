"""Helper tool to work around stdout timout of Travis-CI.

If a long-running process does not output anything for 10 minutes
Travis will assume it has stalled, and kill it.  Some tools (like Packer)
can easily go beyond this 10 minute mark without writing to stdout.

Usage:
  travis_wait_improved [--timeout=<mins>] <command>...
  travis_wait_improved (-h | --help)

Options:
  -h --help             Show this message.
  -t --timeout=<mins>   Maximum time process will be allowed to run
                        in minutes [default: 20].
